ðŸ“Œ Repository Description (for GitHub README or repo description):

ðŸ’¡ This project demonstrates a basic implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras on a customer churn prediction problem.
It covers fundamental ANN concepts like:

- Input, Hidden, and Output Layers
- Activation Functions
- Optimizer selection
- Model Compilation and Training
- Prediction and Evaluation

ðŸ§  Dataset used: Churn_Modelling.csv
ðŸ“Š Objective: Predict whether a customer will leave the bank based on their profile and activity.

ðŸ”§ Libraries used: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
